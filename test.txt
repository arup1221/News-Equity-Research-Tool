Maharashtra CM oath ceremony live: Devendra Fadnavis of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) took oath as the chief minister of Maharashtra for the third time on Thursday at 5.30pm in Mumbai's Azad Maidan. Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar served as deputy chief ministers under outgoing chief minister Eknath Shinde under the Mahayuti government.

Eknath Shinde, meanwhile, will take oath as the deputy chief minister, Shiv Sena said. Before the confirmation of Shinde's position in the Maharashtra government, his party leaders had demanded his appointment as chief minister, crediting their leader with delivering a landslide victory to the Mahayuti alliance in the assembly election.

When asked if he would take the oath, Shinde on Wednesday asked everyone to wait until the evening. Ajit Pawar interjected and said, “We will know about Shinde by evening, but I will take it (the oath); I will not wait.”

Shinde smiled at the response. “Dada (Ajit Pawar) has experience of taking [oath] both in the morning and evening,” he said, eliciting laughter. His allusion to an early morning oath-taking in 2019 by Fadnavis and Pawar as the CM and deputy CM of a government that was to collapse five days later.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, several BJP chief ministers and supporters from the Mahayuti allies, including BJP, Shiv Sena and the NCP, will be in attendance at the event. Other than this, several celebrities, including Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, and Ranbir Kapoor will also be seen at the ceremony.
